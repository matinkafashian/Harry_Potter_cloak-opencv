# ðŸ§¥ Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak (OpenCV Project)

This project simulates an invisibility cloak effect using Python and OpenCV.  
It detects a specific colored cloth (e.g., blue or green) in real-time video and replaces that region with a saved background image, creating the illusion of invisibility â€” inspired by Harry Potterâ€™s magical cloak!

## ðŸŽ¥ How It Works
1. Captures the background (without you in the frame).
2. Detects a specific color range using HSV masking.
3. Replaces the cloth area with the background in real-time.

## ðŸ§ª Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy
